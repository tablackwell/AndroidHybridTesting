Spring 2017 W&amp;M Software Engineering Class Project
This was my group's Spring 2017 W&M Software Engineering Class Project. Its not the prettiest, but I figured I'd keep it here for the sake of posterity, since the original GitLab page was deleted. This was the work of (originally 5, then 4) people over the course of semester in a schedule that attempted to emulate real-world time pressure, so make of it what you will. Its likely buggy and not all that useful, and I'm considering it abandoned for now. Check the readme inside the main folder for more information. Its an interesting subject field, but I wouldn't recommend attacking it the way we did. Feel free to mess around with the code, but I won't offer any help with troubleshooting. The java files should be well documented, at least.
